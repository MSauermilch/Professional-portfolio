                <p>Hello! I am Matt and welocome to my page. In my life I have followed many paths. From high school I entered Art school which took me from Houston, tx to Chicago, Il. While in Chicago I was quite busy, studying painting, sculpture and sound.
                    Needing transportion I got into mopeds with turned into a hobby of moped modifications which at its apex had me and 20 other people racing from portland, Maine to Key West,Florida. While still into moped, I needed something that could move me 
                    futher so I got into to motorcycles. Tired of the Chicago winters and a career in high end woodworking, I loaded up the bike and set out south to return to texas.</p>
                <p>After taking the long way back and sending time in New Orleans,LA Tucson,NM Portland,OR and finally Denver,CO I finally returned to Texas to set my stakes. After furthering my career woodworking, metal working, and some movie prop work I wanted to try
                    something new. So here I am at the University of Texas, Austin trying my hand at Full Stack coding.</p>
                <p>Here which in these pages is a small portfolio to show case some of my work for your review. I hope you find joy in my work and if you do please contact me using the contact page. I'm always interested in feedback.</p>
